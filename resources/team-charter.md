# Team Charter

## Instructions

_Answer the questions below and fill out the process sections with your team’s mechanisms to follow your answers. Remove the italicized examples text as you go._

_On real world software teams, you will often create a document like this via a process called [reteaming](https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/experience-reports/dynamic-reteaming-how-we-thrive-by-rebuilding-teams/). Having something that captures the goals and concerns of everyone on a team helps the team work more efficiently together._

* Psychological safety
* Dependability
* Structure and clarity

### Psychological safety

* **How can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?**
  _E.g., Be open to opinions that differ from your own, actively ask for opinions from each member of the team, do not interrupt each other, don’t place blame, all suggestions or questions are encouraged, listened to, considered equally, and never judged_
If you don't say anything, it will only get worse. We're all human, we make mistakes. Make sure we hear everyone's opinion before progressing.

* **How do we address situations where any team member feels unsafe?**
  _E.g., communicate when there is a misunderstanding, don’t move forward until the situation is resolved, directly address and resolve negativity, give and receive feedback with a positive, strength-building mindset, if necessary, escalate to an instructor 
Address it, talk about it. 

### Dependability, Structure, Clarity

* **How can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?**
  _E.g., estimate task size, break down large tasks, call out tasks at risk early, ask each other for help, how to ensure timely code reviews, how to share knowledge, help each other hold accountability give frequent, scheduled updates_
Make it known if you are unsure of a task or an issue and ask for help. If you finish early, see if someone needs help.

* **How do we address missed deadlines?**
  _E.g., acknowledge, but don’t punish slipped dates, figure out what went wrong, identify lessons for future_
Acknowledge in stand-ups and retrospectives, address the issue and cause, learn from it

* **How can we make goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?**
  _E.g., where to track goals and when to review them, use definitive, quantifiable terminology, include clear background on why this goal is necessary, include “done” criteria for the goal (code is pushed with integration tests, document is reviewed, etc.)_
GitHub Issues allows the assignment of goals, roles will be discussed and assigned as necessary by the team during designated times/meetings.

### Goals

* **Overall: What is our overall objective for the Learn & Be Curious unit?**
  _E.g., “Apply what we’ve learned throughout this program in a team project to prepare ourselves for internships and full-time SDE roles.”_
To learn and be curious

* **Performance: What do we want to prioritize in terms of what we achieve?**
  _What will be true when you have 'succeeded' on this project? E.g. enjoy ourselves, maintain our energy to the end, ensure all team members participate, create professional connections, exceed instructor expectations, efficiently pace the project so we’re not rushing at the end, etc._
Simplicity and functionality before complexity

* **Learning: What are the things that our team wants to learn?**
  _E.g., develop SDE knowledge, enhance leadership skills, master project planning, improve testing skills, etc_
How front-end uses the API's. Locking in testing skills. GitHub intricacies. AWS in general

* **Task processes: What processes will our team follow to meet our goals, complete tasks, or to build team relationships?**
  _E.g., leadership, meeting procedures/length of meetings, expectations for meeting attendance and timeliness, other types of meetings (happy hours, lunch and learns)_
Stand-ups/Meetings to discuss/assign goals and tasks. Using time wisely.
